Basic description and instructions:

There are 2 folders with the following content
- whereTest: Contain the selenium tests
- where: Contain the scenario I was supposed to suppose, working but not perfect

Everything is based on assumptions, it was not fully tested but should be almost working with few changes.

I've uploaded the coupons example to: http://iokapi.com/b/where and I'm using that assumption too in the test code.

Any questions please feel free to contact me again.

Thanks!
Bernardo
